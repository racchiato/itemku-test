# itemku-test

This is my answers for the tests given at the google form for the software engineer vacancy.

### Question 1
I utilized the Map object to maintain uniqueness by the userid.

### Question 2
Like question 1, I utilized Map object to store the failure rates in each stage, then sort it using insertion sort to a new array

### Question 3
To be honest I don't know whether my code will be buggy, but for now given the example input and output all I do is:
- Get unique single attribute by comparing it to each other
- Exclude unique single attribute in the search of candidate keys
- Combine columns and compare it with each other
